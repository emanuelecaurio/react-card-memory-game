Memory Game made with React using UTF-8 icons.

Mobile & Desktop ready!

**works with**: `React >= 16.8`
## ✔️ Getting Started

You can install the module via `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
npm install react-card-memory-game
```

```sh
yarn add react-card-memory-game
```

## 💻 Demo
[Live Demo](https://react-card-memory-game.surge.sh/)

## 📁 Project Structure
The project includes a demo folder initialized with Create React App.

When you run the command ```build``` from first-level ```package.json```, a ```dist``` and a ```lib``` folder will be generated.

The ```lib``` folder will be placed automatically into the demo project.

You can move into ```demo``` directory and ```start``` project from its own package.json script, just like any other Create React App.

## 🔨 Usage

```js
import MemoryGame from 'react-card-memory-game'

function App() {
    return (
       <div>
           <MemoryGame gridNumber={4}/>
       </div>
    );
}
```
This is the bare minimum to have a working memory game.

A more in-depth example is available on `demo/src/App.js`
